# AI-Driven Test Automation Agent

## Overview
This project leverages advanced AI techniques to automate the generation of test scripts for software applications. Using language models like GPT, it analyzes test cases and automatically generates Python test scripts using popular testing frameworks like `pytest`, `Selenium`, and `Playwright`.

The goal of this project is to create an AI-driven tool that significantly reduces the effort and time required for software testing by automating the generation of test cases and corresponding Python code.

## Features
- **Test Case Analysis**: Automatically analyzes input test cases and identifies the necessary steps for testing.
- **Test Script Generation**: Uses AI to generate Python test scripts using various testing frameworks like `pytest`, `Selenium`, and `Playwright`.
- **Modular and Maintainable Code**: The generated test scripts follow best practices for readability and maintainability, with support for setup/teardown, fixtures, and assertions.
- **Flexible Framework Support**: Easily extendable to support different testing frameworks and libraries.

## How It Works
1. **Input Test Cases**: Provide detailed test cases describing software features and expected behavior.
2. **AI-Powered Test Code Generation**: The tool analyzes the input and generates Python test scripts with detailed comments describing the test objectives, steps, and expected results.
3. **Customization**: You can choose between multiple testing frameworks like `pytest`, `Selenium`, and `Playwright`.
4. **Output**: The generated test scripts are ready for execution, ensuring fast and accurate testing.
